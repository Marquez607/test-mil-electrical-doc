   SubjuGator 8 Kill System


Each vehicle in MIL needs and haves a kill system. The purpose of the kill system is to cut power to the actuators of the vehicle when any of a number of kill inputs are set to true. In this way vehicle, environment, and animal safety is maximized. Possible kill inputs include buttons on the vehicle, buttons on a remote, software kills initiated via command, and autonomously activated software kills.
